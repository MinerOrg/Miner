# Miner - a game inspired by Minecraft
I'm going to try to have: 
* very good graphics (thanks ue, sort of)
* cool world gen
* realistic mechanics (we removed fireflies being eaten by frogs because they are poisonous)
* Smart AI
* maybe have good performance

## Helpful git commands
* Save a signing key password for 3600 seconds: 
   <pre>ssh-add -t 3600 [SSH SIGNING KEY]</pre>
